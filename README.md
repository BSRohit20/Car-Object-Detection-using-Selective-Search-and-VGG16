Car Object Detection using Selective Search and VGG16
This repository implements car object detection using Selective Search to generate region proposals and a pre-trained VGG16 model for classification. The process involves loading labeled data, performing Selective Search to propose bounding boxes, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a region contains a car or not.

Project Structure
car-object-detection/data/training_images: Folder containing training images.
car-object-detection/data/testing_images: Folder containing test images.
car-object-detection/data/train_solution_bounding_boxes (1).csv: CSV file with bounding box annotations for training images.
Code Explanation
1. Import Required Libraries
The code begins by importing all the necessary libraries for data processing, image handling, model building, and evaluation.

2. Load and Display Training Data
The labels for the bounding boxes are read from a CSV file. A display_image function is defined to display images with bounding boxes drawn on them. This is useful for visualizing the bounding boxes around the cars.

python
Copy code
labels = pd.read_csv(annot)
3. Selective Search
The code uses OpenCVâ€™s Selective Search Segmentation to generate region proposals. For each image, a set of bounding boxes is generated, which are then evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) to determine whether they contain a car.

python
Copy code
ss = cv2.ximgproc.segmentation.createSelectiveSearchSegmentation()
4. Intersection over Union (IoU)
A custom get_iou function calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes. This helps in filtering region proposals by comparing them with the ground truth bounding boxes.

python
Copy code
def get_iou(bb1, bb2):
    # IoU logic
    return iou
5. Data Preprocessing
The region proposals are resized to 224x224 (input size for VGG16), and labels are generated for each proposal:

Label 1 for regions with IoU > 0.5 (car present)
Label 0 for regions with IoU < 0.3 (no car)
python
Copy code
cv2.resize(timage, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
6. Model Definition
A pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded, excluding its top layer. A new Dense layer with softmax activation is added for binary classification (car vs. no car).

python
Copy code
vggmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)
X = vggmodel.layers[-2].output
predictions = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(X)
model_final = Model(vggmodel.input, predictions)
7. Compilation and Training
The model is compiled using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation, and training is performed with early stopping and model checkpointing.

python
Copy code
model_final.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy, optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), metrics=["accuracy"])
hist = model_final.fit_generator(generator=traindata, steps_per_epoch=10, epochs=20, validation_data=testdata, validation_steps=2, callbacks=[checkpoint, early])
8. Model Evaluation and Prediction
After training, the model is tested on unseen images, predicting whether the detected regions contain cars.

python
Copy code
out = model_final.predict(img)
if out[0][0] > out[0][1]:
    print("Car")
else:
    print("Not Car")
9. Visualization of Results
The predicted bounding boxes are drawn on the images for visualization.

python
Copy code
rect = patches.Rectangle((box['x1'], box['y1']), box['x2']-box['x1'], box['y2']-box['y1'], linewidth=1, edgecolor='green', facecolor='none')
ax.add_patch(rect)
Running the Code
Ensure the required libraries are installed.
Place the training images and bounding box annotations in the appropriate directories.
Run the script to perform object detection and train the model:
bash
Copy code
python object_detection.py
After training, the model will predict car regions from the test images.
Results
Model Accuracy: The model's accuracy and loss are plotted after training using Matplotlib.
Bounding Box Visualization: The detected car bounding boxes are drawn and displayed on test images.
Future Improvements
Use additional data augmentation techniques for better generalization.
Fine-tune the VGG16 model or experiment with other architectures.
Implement Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate overlapping boxes.
